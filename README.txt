 This is a MAD LIB story generator project. 
 
 I have a simple home page with a 3 anchor nav bar. 

You can select 'Our Mad Lib Story' which will take you to a form to complete the mad lib provided. After submitting that you are taken to the 'Generated Mad Libs' anchor page which shows a list of stories from the session.

You can also go to the 'Create A Mad Lib Story' anchor page to write or past in your own story with a specific formatting...
This will then lead to a form populated with those parts of speech. You complete the form, then submit it and go to the generated stories page with the most recent story at the top.

See screenshots for a demo.
